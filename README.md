# Haskell Calc

A small program to teach myself [Haskell](https://haskell.org). It reads a simple expression from the command line and evaluates it.  

## Prerequisites
[Haskell Stack](https://haskellstack.org) version 1.9 or later is needed to build the project.  
Run `stack setup` in the repo to install and configure the correct Haskell compiler.

## Build and run
Run `stack run -- '1 + 1'` to try it. You can insert any expression, whitespaces are automatically ignored.

## Install locally
Run `stack install`, it will install the `calc` executable in your `PATH`.
